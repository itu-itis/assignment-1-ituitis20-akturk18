<i>NISANTASI NURI AKIN ANATOLIAN HIGH SCHOOL</i></h1>

<h2><i>History</i></h2>


<img src="picturennaal.jpg" alt="nnaalphoto" style="float:right;width:300px;height:300px;">
<p>Our school started its education in 1914 under the name of<i> Nişantaşı Erkek Sultanisi.</i> In 1919 it moved to the Fehmi Pasha mansion in Nişantaşı.In 1923, it was named <i>Nişantaşı High School.</i> The school, which was transferred to the Valide Sultan Palace in the 1924-1925 academic year, served here as a secondary school until 1939. Since this mansion could not afford the needs of the time, the foundation of the part of the same building, which is defined as the old building today, was laid in the garden of the same building in 1936 and this place was opened to education in the 1939-1940 academic year. Our school, which was named <i>"Nişantaşı Erkek Ortaokulu"</i> in the 1947-1948 academic year, was transformed into a girls' high school in the 1956-1957 academic year and was named <i>"Nişantaşı Kız Lisesi".</i> The first director of this period is Ali Kutun Bey. The foundation of the new building was laid on 30 October 1968. It was opened to education in the period of 1972-1973 as a result of studies lasting about 4 years. Students were accepted to our school for the middle first grade in 1992-1993 academic year. In our school, which gradually abolished secondary school, only high school education has been provided since 1994-1995. In our school, due to the restoration works initiated by the Rüştü Akın Foundation before the 1997-1998 academic year, the part defined as the old building was closed to education, and education was continued in the new building. After Rüştü Akın Foundation completed the part of the school called the new building and the garden arrangement, our school took the name <i>"Nişantaşı Nuri Akın High School"</i> as of the academic year 1999-2000 and took its place among the distinguished schools with its modern appearance, modern educational facilities. Our school was named <i>"Nişantaşı Nuri Akın Anatolian High School"</i> in the 2005-2006 academic year as an Anatolian high school. Our school still continues its education and training named <i>"Nişantaşı Nuri Akın Anatolian High School". </i></p><br><br><br><hr><br><br>
