<h2>About Me</h2>




<div><p>
I graduated from my high school in 2018 and I enrolled ITU preparation school that year.
 My department was Electronics at the beginning since my exam point was not enough to transfer Computer Engineering.
 To make my dreams happen, I should have passed Computer Engineering so I studied hard and I completed my first license year by giving all lectures AA.
 Then I transferred from Electronics to my dream department thanks to GPA.
 Why I decided to be a Computer Engineering is that I am very curious about computer programs and also how computers actually work.
 I love thinking with numbers in my life so I can say that I love analytical thinking.
 I like to be creative at the coding programs like Python, C etc. Besides; I love hardware systems of computers even if I donâ€™t have enough information about them.
 Also, I am interested in stock market and there are some algorithms which can make automatically trade according to some conditions. I want to create my own algorithm in the stock market system.
 I will be working on this problem during the university education. When I am writing a code such as Python I feel myself free and happy, which increases my focus level and my success.
 These are the reasons why I have selected this department actually. In short, I am happy to be here and I strongly believe that I will be successful engineer in this department.
